# Soulstone Rules

Each player starts with 2000 Life. The first player to reach 0 loses. Player 1 gets a turn then Player 2 gets a turn then so on until one player loses. When your turn begins, you can summon creatures once each turn to an unoccupied zone by paying some amount of Life, then choosing a Power number and a Strength number, but they must add up to the Life you paid. Creatures cannot attack the turn they are summoned. After you summon a creature, you can attack with your creatures that were not summoned that turn, once per creature. In the case that your opponent controls a creature, you can attack it with a creature that was not summoned this turn. If the Power number of the attacking creature is greater than the Strength number of the attacked creature, the attacked creature is destroyed. If the Strength number of the attacking creature is greater than the Power number of the attacked creature, the attacking creature is destroyed. If both cases are true, both creatures are destroyed. In the case that your opponent controls no creatures, you can attack your opponent directly. In this case, the attacked player loses Life equal to the Power number of the Attacking creature. After this all happens, your opponent's turn starts.
